This effort resulted in a remarkable 90% reduction in test failures and ensured a synchronized testing environment. Additionally, I conducted testing on more than 40 internal and external endpoints across all four REST API services within the company, identifying and reporting multiple bugs. I utilized tools like Cucumber, JUnit, Postman, cURL, and Postico for this task.
